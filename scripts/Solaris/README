This directory contains init-scripts and SMF manifests and methods
for integration of NUT services with Solaris and descendant OSes.

This also includes the nut-driver-enumerator.sh (service and implementation
method) and upsdrvsvcctl (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances,
which are stored in ../upsdrvsvcctl/ subdirectory (portable codebase shared
with Linux systemd).

Note that at the moment there is no out-of-the-box integration for triggering
a restart/refresh of the nut-driver-enumerator SMF service when the `ups.conf`
file is modified, like there is with systemd path unit type. Due to this, the
systems administrator is expected to `svcadm refresh nut-driver-enumerator`
after changing the NUT configuration or wait until the daemonized mode picks up
the change (should within a minute). However, a DTrace script or a tool like
https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch wrapped into a service might be used
for equivalent effect.

Alternatively, but somewhat more expensively, the same nut-driver-enumerator.sh
script can be executed in a loop as the payload of the SMF service to keep
inspecting the configuration and apply changes to the running system. It is
not a common use-case to keep changing device setups, so this solution is not
enforced by default ;) although a service variant is provided...

This directory contains the NUT support files for systemd, the System and
Service Manager.

These files are automatically installed, upon detection (at configure time)
of a systemd enabled system.

This also uses the `nut-driver-enumerator.sh` (service and implementation
method) and `upsdrvsvcctl` (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances
located in `../upsdrvsvcctl/` source subdirectory. Two service bundles are
provided for this: a set of `nut-driver-enumerator-daemon*` units starts
the script as a daemon to regularly inspect and apply the NUT configuration
to OS service unit wrappings (mainly intended for monitoring systems with
a dynamic set of monitored power devices, or for systems where filesystem
events monitoring is not a clockwork-reliable mechanism to 100% rely on);
the other `nut-driver-enumerator.*` units run the script once per triggering
of the service (usually during boot-up; configuration file changes can be
detected and propagated by systemd most of the time).

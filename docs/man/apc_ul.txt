NAME
----

apc_ul - Driver for APC Smart-UPS Microlink protocol UPSes

SYNOPSIS
--------

*apc_ul* -h

*apc_ul* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']


SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

Works over serial with any Microlink capable APC UPS, most models that 
have an RJ50 port which is not labelled "USB" should work.

Recommended to only use it with units that have 2 or less outlet groups 
as some with more don't accept shutdown commands properly.

Driver is experimental and uses a completely undefined / undocumented
protocol so may break at any time, especially after updating firmware. 
Use at your own risk. 

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

Nothing documented here yet.

BUGS
----

Shutdown does not work on models with 3 outlets.

Unit may timeout if communication goes silent for too long. If this 
happens, try increasing the poll interval (1 second is recommended, 
lower is better). It essentiall needs to be constantly polling the 
device.
